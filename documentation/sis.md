# Social Impact Statement

** New System and Its Benefits **

#### Convey the high-level goals of the new system:
Our software will be used for the numerical simulation of quartz tube quenching of metallic glass. It will compute the process of temperature evolution of the alloy in the tube and of the tube itself. The software will produce temperature vs. time data in the problem domain. It will also store the data in a binary format conforming to a recognized standard that can be used for other research software. Our software will include several features for analysis purposes, including visualizing data file and calculating temperature differences.

#### Identify the stakeholders:
Stakeholders will include our client Dr. Lee and physics students. The software will be open source and could be used by other institutions.

#### Identify specific benefits:
Temperature changes due to both diffusion and radiation, and as the temperature changes, the conductivity of the material changes. This software will provide estimation for parameters of production of metallic glass, such as the maximum radius that allows the alloy to stay pure. It will also be a good tool to study the impact of radiation in cooling.
