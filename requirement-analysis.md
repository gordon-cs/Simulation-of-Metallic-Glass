## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose of the system
The purpose of the system is to produce heat diffusion simulation of the
quenching in the production process of metallic glass.

### 1.2 Scope of the system
The scope of the system will be accessed by researchers around the world.

### 1.3 Objectives and Success Criteria of the Project
The server shall successfully produce a binary file that contain the simulation
result. The user software should be able to login and initiate computation.
After computation is done, the user software shall receive and read the binary
file, and do several simple analysis.

### 1.6 Overview
A user can use client software to send initial conditions to the server.
After the server finishes computations, it sends back the data file.
The data file consists of hundreds of matrices with each one representing
temperatures at 2-D locations at a specific time.
The user can then use software to analyze data, for instance, show temperature
difference between two different points at the same time on the graph, or show
a graph of temperature vs. time at one specific position.
